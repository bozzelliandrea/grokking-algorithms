/*
Linear Traversal Approach

Algorithm
Initialize variables:
count = 0, to count the total number of negative elements in the matrix.
n = grid[0].size(), to store the number of elements in each row.
currRowNegativeIndex = n - 1, to store the current row's first negative element's index.
For each row of the grid, we decrease currRowNegativeIndex by 1 until we point to the last positive element of the current row. And thus, we know all elements to the right of this pointer will be negative so we add n - (currRowNegativeIndex + 1) to the count.
Return count.

    let currRowNegativeIndex = n - 1;

    // Iterate on all rows of the matrix one by one.
